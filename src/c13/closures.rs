/// Functional Language Features: Iterators and Closures
///
/// Rust's design has taken inspiration from many existing languages and techniques, and one
/// significant influence is functional programming. Programming in a functional style often
/// includes using functions as values by passing them in arguments, returning them from other
/// functions, assigning them to variables for later execution, and so forth.
///
/// Closures: Anonymous Functions That Capture Their Environment
///
/// Rust's closures are anonymous functions you can save in a variable or pass as arguments to other
/// functions. You can create the closure in one place and then call the closure elsewhere to
/// evaluate it in a different context. Unlike functions, closures can capture values from the scope
/// in which they're defined.
///
/// Capturing the Environment with Closures
///
/// Here's the scenario: Every so often, our t-shirt company gives away an exclusive,
/// limited-edition shirt to someone on our mailing list as a promotion. People on the mailing list
/// can optionally add their favourite color to their profile. If the person chosen for a free shirt
/// has their favourite color set, they get that color shirt. If the person hasn't specified a
/// favourite color, they get whatever color the company has the most of.
