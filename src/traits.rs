/// Traits: Defining Shared Behaviour
///
/// A trait defines the functionality a particular type has and can share with other types. We can
/// use traits to defined shared behaviour in an abstract way. We can use trait bounds to specify
/// that a generic type can be any type that has certain behaviour.
///
///     Note: Traits are similar to a feature often called interfaces in other languages, although
///     with some differences.
///
/// Defining a Trait
///
/// A type's behaviour consists of the methods we can call on that type. Different types share the
/// same behaviour if we can call the same methods on all of those types. Trait definitions are a
/// way to group method signatures together to define a set of behaviours necessary to accomplish
/// some purpose.
///
/// For example, let's say we have multiple structs that hold various kinds and amounts of text: a
/// NewsArticle struct that holds a new story filed in a particular location and a SocialPost that
/// can have, at most, 280 characters along with metadata that indicates whether it was a new post,
/// or repost, or a reply to another post.
///
/// We want to make a media aggregator library crate named aggregator that can display summaries of
/// data that might be stored in a NewsArticle or SocialPost instance. To do this, we need a
/// summary from each type, and we'll request that summary by calling a summarize method on an
/// instance. Listing 10-12 shows the definition of a public Summary trait that expresses this
/// behaviour.
///
///     pub trait Summary {
///         fn summarize(&self) -> String;
///     }
///     Listing 10-12: A Summary trait that consists of the behaviour provided by a summarize method
/// Here, we declare a trait using the trait keyword and then the trait's name, which is Summary in
/// this case. We also declare this trait as pub so that crates depending on this crate can make
/// use of this trait too, as we'll see in a few examples. Inside the curly brackets, we declare
/// the method signatures that describes the behaviours of the types that implement this trait,
/// which in this case is fn summarize(&self) -> String.
///
/// After the method signature, instead of providing an implementation within curly brackets, we
/// use a semicolon. Each type implementing this trait must provide its own custom behaviour for
/// the body of the method. The compiler will enforce that any type that has the Summary trait will
/// have the method summarize defined with this signature exactly.
///
/// A trait can have multiple methods in its body: the method signatures are listed one per line,
/// and each line ends in a semicolon.
///
/// Implementing a Trait on a Type
///
/// Now that we've defined the desired signatures of the Summary trait's methods, we can implement
/// it on the types in our media aggregator. Listing 10-13 shows an implementation of the Summary
/// trait on the NewsArticle struct that uses the headline, the author, and the location to create
/// the return value of summarize. For the SocialPost struct, we define summarize as the username
/// followed by the entire text of the post, assuming that the post content is already limited to
/// 280 characters.
///
///     pub struct NewsArticle {
///         pub headline: String,
///         pub location: String,
///         pub author: String,
///         pub content: String,
///     }
///
///     impl Summary for NewsArticle {
///         fn summarize(&self) -> String {
///             format!("{}, by {} ({})", self.headline, self.author, self.location)
///         }
///     }
///
///     pub struct SocialPost {
///         pub username: String,
///         pub content: String,
///         pub reply: bool,
///         pub repost: bool,
///     }
///
///     impl Summary for SocialPost {
///         fn summarize(&self) -> String {
///             format!("{}: {}", self.username, self.content)
///         }
///     }
///     Listing 10-13: Implementing the Summary trait on the NewsArticle and SocialPost types
/// Implementing a trait on a type is similar to implementing regular methods. The difference is
/// that after impl, we put the trait name we want to implement, then use the for keyword,and then
/// specify the name of the type we want to implement the trait for. Within the impl block, we put
/// the method signatures that the trait definition has defined. Instead of adding a semicolon
/// after each signature, we use curly brackets and fill in the method body with the specific
/// behaviour that we want the methods of the trait to have for the particular type.
///
/// Now that the library has implemented the Summary trait on NewsArticle and SocialPost, users of
/// the crate can call the trait methods on instances of NewsArticle and SocialPost in the same way
/// we call regular methods. The only difference is that the user must bring the trait into scope
/// as well as the types. Here's an example of how a binary crate could use our aggregator library
/// crate:
///
///     use aggregator::{SocialPost, Summary};
///
///     fn main() {
///         let post = SocialPost {
///             username: String::from("horse_ebooks"),
///             content: String::from(
///                 "of course, as you probably already know, people",
///             ),
///             reply: false,
///             repost: false,
///         }
///
///         println!("1 new post: {}", post.summarize());
///     }
/// This code prints 1 new post: horse_ebooks: of course, as you probably already know, people.
///
/// Other crates that depend on the aggregator crate can also bring the Summary trait into scope to
/// implement Summary on their own types. One restriction to note is that we can implement a trait
/// on a type only if either the trait or the type, or both, are local to our crate. For example,
/// we can implement standard library traits like Display on a custom type like SocialPost as part
/// of our aggregator crate functionality because the type SocialPost is local to our aggregator
/// crate. We can also implement Summary on Vec<T> in our aggregator crate because the trait
/// Summary is local to our aggregator crate.
///
/// But we can't implement external traits on external types. For example, we can't implement the
/// Display trait on Vec<T> within our aggregator crate because Display and Vec<T> are both defined
/// in standard library and aren't local to our aggregator crate. This restriction is part of a
/// property called coherence, and more specifically the orphan rule, so named because the parent
/// type is not present. This rule ensures that other people's code can't break your code and vice
/// versa. Without the rule, two crates could implement the same trait for the same type, and Rust
/// wouldn't know which implementation to use.
///
/// Default Implementations
///
/// Sometimes it's useful to have default behaviour for some or all of the methods in a trait
/// instead of requiring implementations for all methods on every type. Then, as we implement the
/// trait on a particular type, we can keep or override each method's default behaviour.
///
/// In Listing 10-14, we specify a default string for the summarize method of the Summary trait
/// instead of only defining the method signature, as we did in Listing 10-12.
///
///     pub trait Summary {
///         fn summarize(&self) -> String {
///             String::from("(Read more...)")
///         }
///     }
///     Listing 10-14: Defining a Summary trait with a default implementation of the summarize method
/// To use a default implementation to summarize instances of NewsArticle, we specify an empty impl
/// block with impl Summary for NewsArticle {}.
///
/// Even though we're no longer defining the summarize method on NewsArticle directly, we've
/// provided a default implementation and specified that NewsArticle implements the Summary trait.
/// As a result, we can still call the summarize method on an instance of NewsArticle, like this:
///
///     let article = NewsArticle {
///         headline: String::from("Penguins win the Stanley Cup Championship!"),
///         location: String::from("Pittsburgh, PA, USA"),
///         author: String::from("Iceburgh"),
///         content: String::from(
///             "The Pittsburgh Penguins once again are the best \
///             hockey team in the NHL.",
///         ),
///     };
///
///     println!("New article available {}", article.summarize());
/// This code prints New article available! (Read more...)
///
/// Creating a default implementation doesn't require us to change anything about the implementation
/// of Summary on SocialPost in Listing 10-13. The reason is that the syntax for overriding a
/// default implementation is the same as the syntax for implementing a trait method that doesn't
/// have a default implementation.
///
/// Default implementations can call other methods in the same trait, even if those other methods
/// doesn't have a default implementation. In this way, a trait can provide a lot of useful
/// functionality and only require implementors to specify a small part of it. For example, we could
/// define the Summary trait to have a summarize_author method whose implementation is required, and
/// then define a summarize method that has a default implementation that calls the summarize_author
/// method:
///
///     pub trait Summary {
///         fn summarize_author(&self) -> String;
///
///         fn summarize(&self) -> String {
///             format!("(Read more from {}...)", self.summarize_author())
///         }
///     }
/// To use this version of Summary, we only need to define summarize_author when we implement the
/// trait on a type:
///
///     imply Summary for SocialPost {
///         fn summarize_author(&self) -> String {
///             format!("@{}", self.username)
///         }
///     }
/// After we define summarize_author, we can call summarize on instances of the SocialPost struct,
/// and the default implementation of summarize will call the definition of summarize_author that
/// we've provided. Because we've implemented summarize_author, the Summary trait has given us the
/// behaviour of the Summarize method without requiring us to write any more code. Here's what that
/// looks like:
///
///     let post = SocialPost {
///         username: String::from("horse_ebooks"),
///         content: String::from(
///             "of course, as you probably already know, people",
///         ),
///         reply: false,
///         repost: false,
///     };
///
///     println!("1 new post: {}", post.summarize());
/// This code prints 1 new post: (Read more from @horse_ebooks...).
///
/// Note that it isn't possible to call the default implementation from an overriding implementation
/// of that same method.
///
